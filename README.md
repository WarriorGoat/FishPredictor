# FishPredictor

This project is the creation of a tool for predicting the tide, weather, moonphase, and currents for a given location to enable fisherman to plan their trips around favorable conditions.

api data will be accessed from the public NOAA databases

user input will start with the dates and the state.  A drop down menu will then allow the user to pick the tide station closest to their location.  Once selected, the tool will pull and display the API data for the selected location on the given date, plus 2-5 days on either side of the selected date.
